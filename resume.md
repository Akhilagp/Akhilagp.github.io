## EXPERIENCE

**VISA Inc., Senior Data Engineer**  
*Jan 2023 – Jul 2024*  
- Built and optimized EMV 3-D Secure streaming data pipelines via Kafka + Spark, scaling to 500M+ transactions/day with <1s latency.  
- Designed a new billing engine for frictionless authentication traffic, unlocking $12M in month-on-month revenue.  
- Integrated LLM-powered SQL rewriter, cutting complex billing query run-times by 67% (2.3h → 45m).  
- Optimized stream processing infra for 30M+ events/hour by fine-tuning Kafka, Spark parallelism, and JVM config, ensuring 0% data loss.  
- Led PB-scale migration of merchant/PII datasets from Oracle-Hadoop to OSS Hadoop via Airflow CI/CD, achieving zero-defect cut-over.  
- Prototyped an identity-graph system with entity resolution, boosting fraud detection accuracy by 20%.

**VISA Inc., Data Engineer**  
*Oct 2020 – Dec 2022*  
- Supported large-scale data infrastructure and observability tools to enhance data quality and business intelligence.  
- Automated ingestion of third-party data using Airflow + Spark + dbt, eliminating 12 hrs/week of manual effort.  
- Developed an API-driven CDC replication framework to sync multi-region stores for seamless disaster recovery.  
- Cut client issue resolution time by 40% with Grafana-based real-time monitoring and alerts.
